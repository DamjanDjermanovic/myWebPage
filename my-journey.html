        <h2 class="highlight">At a crossroads of life-changing decisions</h2>
        <p>After finishing high school, I found myself at a weird spot in life, I had no idea what I wanted to study or become in life.</p> 
          <p>I applied for entrance exam at FON University department for IT which is currently most sought-after uni in Serbia.
          <p>After results came in found out I was accepted. Problem was that I, a clueless 19-year-old, didn't take time to look at syllabus,
          to think is this uni really for me. I only knew it had something to do with programming and that everyone goes there.</p>
          <p>After 3 years of struggling with courses I had no interest in (economics, management, marketing, etc.), 
          and not studying for a single programming course I decided to drop out.</p> 
          <p>Stranded without a goal, and hope only two options I had were ether to work at local factory for minimum wage or start something new 
          and convince parents that there's still hope left.</p> 
          <p>That's when I stumbled upon CS50.</p>

        <h2 class="highlight">Discovery of a course that made me fall <br> in love with programming</h2>
        <p>While mindlessly scrolling TikTok in misery because my life is falling apart, 
        I stumbled upon a gem I still remember exact video from Frank Niu, where he list best free programming course.</p>
        <p>At first I was skeptical why would such a famous institution like Harvard give something for free. 
        Upon further inspection I found out that he actually wasn't lying, so I enrolled immediately.</p>
        <p>After first lecture I was hooked, I was really enjoying the project-oriented nature of CS50. 
        I loved watching David's lectures and solving problem sets. That reignited my passion for studying and 
        in those hard moments I decided to enroll to higher school (it's 3 year program not 4 like uni). I was studying both CS50
        and college courses from november to january, then I took a brake from CS50 on week 8 for exam period.</p>

        <h2 class="highlight">Programming in C on CS50 and college</h2>
        <p>If I remember correctly week 2 to week 5 lectures were on programming language C. 
        C really grew to my heart and the fact that in second semester on college I had course focused
        only on C. Previous experience I gained from CS50 made college work easy, I only had to learn 
        few new things like binary operators that's not mentioned in CS50.</p>
        <p>I passed both my exams in C with perfect score and 
        I can say with certainty the greatest credit for my perfect score goes to CS50.</p>
        <p>When I came back to course on problem set 8 I didn't want to make some basic WebSite
        just to meet the requirements, I wanted to make something I would really be satisfied with 
        seeing on internet. That's when I wrote a thread on reddit, where I asked more experienced 
        programmers about their opinion on what's the next best move (click here to see a thread).</p>

        <h2 class="highlight">The next step of programming journey</h2>
        <p>Open source Web Development course that everyone recommended and praised was a no-brainer choice, 
        so the next step was The Odin Project.</p>
        <p>I was finishing first part of the course (the fundamentals) when I had to take another break from online courses
        due to summer exam period. After summer exam period, here I am, I wanted to refresh my WebDev knowledge and I thought of 
        a nice way to do it that can benefit both my courses so I made this WebPage to revisit all the major projects
        I've done in The Odin Project and finish week eight problem set.</p>
        <p>In this project I learned many new things, and improved the code and functionality of projects that I already did in ToP
        my Etch-A-Sketch is far better in this project, I reduced number of lines and complexity of rock paper scissors.</p>
        <p>Now I plan to finish CS50, for my final project I'll make portfolio site, and after getting certificate I plan to apply 
        for a entry level job in American company that has office in my city. My first goal there will be to learn new things, 
        learning while having a income would be a really nice thing.</p>
